# Macbook Setup
Some day I'd like to have a similar setup to Jeff Geerlingguys [repo](https://github.com/geerlingguy/mac-dev-playbook)
For now I'll just list out the software I need to install and let icloud backups do the rest
+ Simlink to ansible files
```
mkdir ~/source
ln -s ~/Library/Mobile\ Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/ansible-files ~/source
```
## Software to download
+ docker
+ vscode
+ wireguard
+ chatgpt
+ cmake
+ raspberry pi imager
+ chrome?

## Restore ssh keys from icloud
